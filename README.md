Shopping made easy-Grab and Go( Leveraging Computer Vision for Intelligent Shopping)
This project explores the use of object detection techniques to streamline grocery inventory management, enabling efficient product tracking and stock control. The traditional shopping process with barcodes and cashiers being inefficient, leads to long queues and slow payment processes.

OBJECT DETECTION PIPELINE: 
Develop a comprehensive workflow for object detection, from data preprocessing to model deployment. 

YOLO V8 FRAMEWORK: Utilized the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model for efficient and accurate object detection

 DATA PREPARATION:Cleaned and annotated a diverse dataset of images for training the object detection model.

MODEL TRAINING: Fine-tuned the YOLOv8 model on the prepared dataset to optimize its performance for the target application.

MODEL EVALUATION: Thoroughly evaluated the trained model's accuracy, precision, and recall on a separate test dataset.
